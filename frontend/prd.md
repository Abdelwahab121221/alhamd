| **FR001**          | **User Registration**        | As a new user, I want to create an account to save and manage my URL lists.         | The system allows users to sign up via email or social media. Successful registration triggers a confirmation email.         |
| **FR002**          | **User Login**               | As a registered user, I want to log in to access my saved URL lists.                | Users can log in with email/password or social media. Failed attempts show clear error messages.                             |
| **FR003**          | **Create a New List**        | As a user, I want to create a new, empty list to start compiling URLs.              | An "Add New List" button initializes an empty list. Users can name the list and start adding URLs.                           |
| **FR004**          | **Add URLs to a List**       | As a user, I want to input or paste URLs into my list to curate resources.          | An input field accepts URLs. Submitted URLs are validated and added to the list with auto-fetched metadata (title, favicon). |
| **FR005**          | **Edit URLs in a List**      | As a user, I want to correct or update URLs if they change or contain errors.       | Users can click an "Edit" button on any URL to modify the link or metadata. Changes save automatically.                      |

| **FR007**          | **Customize List URL**       | As a user, I want a custom URL for my list (e.g., `theurlist.com/my-travel-links`). | Users input a custom slug. The system checks for uniqueness and reserves the URL upon confirmation.                          |
| **FR008**          | **Automatic URL Generation** | As a user, I want the system to generate a unique URL if I don’t customize one.     | If no custom URL is provided, the system creates a random, readable URL (e.g., `theurlist.com/abc123`).                      |
| **FR009**          | **Publish a List**           | As a user, I want to publish my list to make it accessible to others.               | A "Publish" button saves the list and makes it live. Users receive a success notification with the shareable link.           |

| **FR012**          | **View/Manage All Lists**    | As a user, I want to see all my lists in one place to edit, delete, or share them.  | A dashboard displays all lists with options to edit, delete, or view analytics. Lists are searchable and sortable.           |
| **FR013**          | **Delete a List**            | As a user, I want to delete an entire list if it’s obsolete.                        | A "Delete List" button removes the list and all associated URLs after confirmation.                                          |
| **FR014**          | **Search Functionality**     | As a user, I want to search my lists or public lists by keywords.                   | A search bar filters lists by title, URL, or metadata. Results update in real time.                                          |

| **FR016**          | **Analytics Dashboard**      | As a user, I want to see how many times my list has been viewed or shared.          | The dashboard displays total views, shares, and referral sources. Data updates in near real time.                            |
